        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This pizza is vegetarian. Not vegan. It does have veggies in it so I guess it's a veggie pizza.
        </p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 (8 ounce) packages refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 (1 ounce) package ranch seasoning mix</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups chopped fresh broccoli</li>
                <li>½ cup halved and thinly-sliced radishes</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
                <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
                <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
    
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a jelly roll pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
               
                <li>Press crescent roll dough into the prepared jelly roll pan to form a crust. Let stand 5 minutes. Pierce with a fork.</li>
      
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dough is fully cooked and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
             
                <li>Combine sour cream, cream cheese, ranch seasoning mix, dill, and garlic salt in a medium mixing bowl. Spread the cream cheese mixture on top of cooled crust. Arrange broccoli, radish, onion, bell pepper, carrot, and celery on top of the cream cheese mixture.</li>
                
                <li>Cover and let chill, 1 to 2 hours. Cut chilled pizza into 16 squares to serve.</li>
            </ol>
